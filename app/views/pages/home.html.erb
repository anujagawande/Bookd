        <p class="lead">There is something about having a printed book that is becoming less and less the norm today! We facilitate book reviews,
                        discussions, recommendations for adults and young children.Books are reviewed and recommended by real people and 
                        books will also be suggested to you based on your career, interests, age, and hobbies just to name a few.
                        In addition, there is a discussion page based on whole books and chapter
                        discussions(not to give away spoilers) to facilitate engagement before, during, and even after reading the book.
                        Sign up today to be a part of Bookd!</p>
